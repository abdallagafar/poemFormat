# poemFormat
A markup and Javascript functions for formatting classic Arabic poems

This code aims at formatting classic Arabic poems using intuitive and natural markup rules. For example, two or more spaces are used to separate the parts of a verse in the poem, which cooincides with the intuitive formatting used in plain text. The goal is to make it as simple as copy-pasting most of the readable plain-text writings of the poems without special care.
In this file we document the different markup rules.
